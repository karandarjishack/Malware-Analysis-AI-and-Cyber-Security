**Overview for Original Midterm :**

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate practical skills in implementing and deploying machine learning models for malware classification. The project involved three main tasks: building and training the model, deploying the model as a cloud API, and creating a client application.

**Technical Approach:**

**Task 1 - Building and Training the Model:**

Implemented a deep neural network based on the MalConv architecture using Python 3.x and PyTorch.
Utilized the EMBER dataset for training and evaluation.
Referenced the sample implementation provided in the EMBER repository, with modifications to align with project requirements.
Incorporated textual description blocks in the Jupyter Notebook to document and explain different parts of the code.


**Task 2 - Deploying the Model as a Cloud API:**

Leveraged Amazon SageMaker to deploy the trained model on the cloud.
Followed AWS documentation and tutorials to understand the deployment process.
Monitored spending on AWS to ensure that charges remained within the allocated budget.


**Task 3 - Creating a Client Application:**

Developed a web application using Streamlit, allowing users to upload PE files.
Converted uploaded files into feature vectors compatible with the MalConv/EMBER model.
Integrated the cloud API to classify uploaded files as malware or benign.
Displayed classification results to the user.
Performance Analysis:

Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F-1 score.
Conducted latency analysis to determine the average time taken for malware detection using the cloud API.
Generated confusion matrices to visualize the model's classification performance.

**Conclusion:**
This project successfully demonstrated the implementation and deployment of a machine learning model for malware classification. By leveraging modern tools and technologies such as PyTorch, Amazon SageMaker, a scalable and user-friendly solution was developed. The model achieved competitive performance metrics, highlighting its potential for real-world application in cybersecurity.

**Overview for Simplified Midterm:**

The aim of this project was to deploy a machine learning model trained for malware classification as an API endpoint on AWS SageMaker. Additionally, a Python client was developed to extract features from executable files and retrieve classification results from the SageMaker endpoint. Testing of the client and endpoint was performed using one malware PE file and one benign PE file from the test dataset created during Lab 5.4.

**Project Goals:**
Deploy a pre-trained malware classification model on AWS SageMaker.

Develop a Python client application to interact with the deployed model.

Demonstrate the system's functionality using test data.


**Technical Approach:**

Deploying the Model on AWS SageMaker:

Utilized the trained model from Lab 5.4 for malware classification.


Followed AWS SageMaker documentation to deploy the model as an API endpoint.
Ensured monitoring of spending on AWS.


**Developing the Python Client:**

Developed a Python client to interact with the deployed SageMaker endpoint.
Integrated functionality to send feature vectors to the SageMaker endpoint and retrieve classification results.



**Performance Analysis:**

Evaluated the performance of the deployed model and Python client based on the accuracy of classification results.
Monitored latency to ensure efficient processing of classification requests.
Conducted thorough testing to verify the robustness and reliability of the system.


**Conclusion:**

This project successfully demonstrated the deployment of a pre-trained malware classification model as a cloud-based API endpoint on AWS SageMaker. The rest of the part havenâ€™t been executed but will be uploaded and documentation will be updated for the same soon for the last part.
